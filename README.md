DataMining-gSpan
==============

gSpan algorithm in data mining

**Features:**

1. Support basic sub-structure mining.
2. Multi-thread. (200% speed-up than gSpan-64 provided by Yan)
3. Minimized memory consumption.

**Usage:**

    ./gspan -file [file_name] -support [support: float] &> log

**Progress:**

1. MPI
2. Optimize the sequential version.
3. Detailed parallelism
